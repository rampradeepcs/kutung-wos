                <div class="col-md-12 p-0">
                    <h2 class="mb-3">Ladies and Gentleman</h2>
                    <p class="m-0 mb-4">Good day! With God in mind, I pray that your families and friends are in good health in this very tumultuous times –Covid 19 has really taught us that nature is all powerful and am fortunate that this realization dawned into me deeply
                        a decade back. I have taken the liberty to share my most innate thoughts behind my mission, a project that shares and reflects nature in its most pristine form … that is coming into fruition now – It is a long story that virtually
                        grew into me, a deep routed philosophy that I feel strongly about and I take great pride in sharing this philosophy with yourselves and request you all to join this mission. It is fairly a long note, but I wanted this opportunity
                        to share these thoughts in full and so please give it your patient reading as it a significantly important one indeed. </p>
                    <p class="m-0 mb-4">The Insight!</p>
                    <p class="m-0 mb-4">All of us have an intense desire to be loved and nurtured and I am a great believer and practioner of same. I always believed that a significant determinant of our happiness is aspiring for a fulfilling life. In the pursuit of this
                        need to be loved, I realized that…It is the ecosystem and environment that makes it possible – I visit the place of worship because the ecosystem brings happiness to my inner self. I always felt that the desire to love and care
                        for others is hard-wired and deep-seated in me and this really helps to share my happiness with others. Expressing love or compassion for others benefits not just the recipient of affection, but also the person who delivers it.
                        In these, stems my mission – to build a beautiful home as a temple of love for all. I ensured that every ingredient of my mission is enveloped with love. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have always been trained to care for others and which
                        I have always practiced to the hilt - this has given me immense happiness and I wanted to share this true selfless love with you all – That is life…and nothing more! I have carved span to be happiness maximizer for you all! and
                        with God in mind I am beginning this mission of care.</p>
                    <p class="m-0 mb-4">E.O. Wilson once said that “The more we know of other forms of life, the more we enjoy and respect ourselves…Humanity is exalted not because we are so far above other living creatures, but because knowing them well elevates the very
                        concept of life in us.”</p>
                    <p class="m-0 mb-4">That’s the world, “Span” has been conceptualized for its beloved home dwellers!</p>
                    <p class="m-0 mb-4">The dawn of greater realization at Span and within me:</p>
                    <p class="m-0 mb-4">The Question! Going back in time, after more than two decades of successful conventional architecture and construction to perfection …a day of introspection dawned on me and my people – what next can we do – for humanity and how can
                        I convey my happiness and love for all! At this very moment, I saw the human and economic toll of climate change … which continues to rise and we face the legitimate risk of our dear homes being uprooted by calamities – largely
                        touted by living outside of nature and belittling it. Nature has also taught us…. less than one gram of Covid 19 can bring the whole world to its knees and sure it did. Only true love and care can save the world from positive calamity.</p>
                    <p class="m-0 mb-4">We also saw how the devastating floods in South Asia took over 1,200 lives and affected over 20 million people, including 6.8 million children. With an estimated 18,000 schools destroyed or damaged throughout India, Bangladesh and
                        Nepal, the education of hundreds of thousands of children has been severely impacted. Take the Chennai floods for instance, more than 500 people died and over 118 lakh people were simply displaced. Looking around the world even
                        in the developed economies, the year 2017 was also one of the costliest years for weather disasters in the United States. Hurricanes Harvey and Irma caused almost $200 billion in damage in just Texas and Florida, while the California
                        wildfires could eventually cost up to $65 billion in property damage. Many simply did not have the resources to rebuild. That’s the home truth, above! We have been dwelling on this for years now….and I, Chandrahasan Senthil Kumar
                        wanted to make a small change but a change for sure…with my devoted team – I strongly felt that it was time for me to repay - repay something back to nature through love and compassion. Thankfully, I am a dreamer – believe in making
                        an impact and I shall…..with all your support. I also realized that with the ongoing disastrous climate change, there are significant impacts on water getting more and more scarce and crops failing and food security taking a different
                        dimension….. I was given to understand that if we fundamentally do not respect nature, it is projected that the number of internal climate migrants will increase dramatically to more than 140 million climate migrants moving within
                        their countries with nowhere to go by 2050. Ladies and Gentlemen, Living within nature to Loving and caring for all is so paramount – At Span, my beloved company, we decided time has come to make a serious dent, a disruptive change
                        into this conventional process of building Homes and build them with Character and Love. We at Span knew, how poorly conceived conventional design visibly divides us and how nature is so isolated from us all the time. The environment
                        appears distant because of the way we practiced traditional design, taught in our schools. The lack of environmental connection, so estrangement from nature has not only directly impacted our health, it has impacted our ability
                        to respond to climate change. I took the important decision that “No more shall Span practice the concept of separation through many an isolating design”. As nature has receded from our daily lives, it has receded from our morals
                        too. Yet there is an innate and deep desire for other species to co-exist. Humans have an ingrained desire to connect to nature and love each other.</p>
                    <p class="m-0 mb-4">At Span, we realized this need, a decade back…..and wanted to make a significant difference - Of course, this called for a complete reset to our thought process with dedication and personal commitment and huge money … also we realized
                        the need for disruption and supporting cutting edge technologies….real breakthroughs on all aspects was the need of the hour. </p>
                    <p class="m-0 mb-4">After a decade of quiet developmental programs and millions in personal investment, we have now all the technology and know-hows to change our proximity to nature and shift our physical relationship to the environment in all its worldly
                        beauty and love. We had the support from a range of technologists and nature believers, and now we have all the necessary cutting-edge first time technologies and high level of capabilities….. for this very new and must mission.
                        It was a true challenge to our designers - to develop unique concepts of architecture that were simply derived from the very smallest elements of nature and niceties springing all over the landscape. At Span.. it is all love and
                        nature from start to finish and we shall do all that is possible to reinvigorate this bond with your inner happiness.</p>
                    <p class="m-0 mb-4">E.O. Wilson aptly describes this impulse in me as “Biophilia Hypothesis” …”Where human beings remove themselves from the natural environment, the biophilic learning rules are not replaced by modern versions equally well adapted to
                        artifacts. Instead, they persist from generation to generation. For the indefinite future… urban dwellers will go on dreaming of nature for reasons they cannot explain.”</p>
                    <p class="m-0 mb-4">We changed it in Span and carved this connection to the natural world and inner happiness. At Span, we ‘Make Nature Visible’ and “Make love True” We are now designing townships grounded in their own distinguishing environment. In this
                        way, our homeowner partners can invigorate an awareness of the natural systems that affect us and recover spirituality and live in happiness and love with nature. We have gone beyond conventional technology and brought in the feeling,
                        the presence of the living world around us to resurrect the good spirit within us. Supporting this movement, we have inventively found ways to reconnect us to nature with the touch and feel of cutting-edge technology all around.
                        Span in partnership with nature – How will Span housing be… With nature providing such joy and many health benefits, we as planners are leveraging designs that accentuate the environment and that will be ingrained in all our spaces.
                        We can hope that beyond making a healthier and happier world, we can also prompt a more ethical relationship to nature.</p>

                    <p class="m-0 mb-4 mt-4 mt-lg-0">When trying say…a new Mediterranean food, we often ask the question: “What does it taste like?” Human mind always seeks clarity via change - appears to be an intrinsic human idiosyncrasy, and this attribute also applies to Span’s Patent
                        Pending novel architecture, for which a feeling with nature can provide great insight into the subtle qualities of a space, happiness and love…. and that is what Span is all about.</p>
                    <p class="m-0 mb-4">Avatar - It is our intention to go beyond describing physical attributes of architecture, more subtle but revolutionary, beyond adjectives and vernaculars which will accentuate and enliven our designs and take you beyond purely academic
                        homes. Some of our structures will be a marvellous concoction of rising and irregular natural material pieces, held together to represent a resilient dance of lightness and gravity.” A representative quality of Span expressing
                        diversity of design across the entire township</p>
                    <p class="m-0 mb-4">We will Set the Scenery for you! We have studied Ancient structures and incorporated them into many facets of our technology. From Pyramids to Temples, to Churches and Mosques.</p>
                    <p class="m-0 mb-4">You will see “natural and material diversity across every unique home which will give that extra resonance to the surrounding nature and encompassing love.</p>
                    <p class="m-0 mb-4">In Span we ask “What is ‘Indian-ness’ at this moment in time? What is our relationship to our traditions, to the architectural identity of our 5000-year-old culture?”</p>
                    <p class="m-0 mb-4">It all Emotion and Love – A Span ingrained Culture at home.</p>
                    <p class="m-0 mb-4">Your home-makers at Span</p>
                    <p class="m-0 mb-4">In Span, all our thinkers, dreamers and architects work through the night to complete a project before their sordid deadlines but they now their work is all emotional going beyond, and beyond the struggles of their work rooms, and
                        their nature designs are nothing but bursts of Love, Inspiration, Passion, delight.</p>
                    <p class="m-0 mb-4">Span are more environmentalists now than puritan builders - doing something to help everyone bond with nature; our designs will emote every aspect of Love and this will become physically manifested within each dear house and</p>

                    <p class="m-0 mb-4">• Every home is different in every respect of the word - from the type of building material to design and what it means to our homeowner partner.</p>
                    <p class="m-0 mb-4">• Span will showcase lead workshops for our home partners design homes that reflect their human experience from cradle to grave. </p>

                    <p class="m-0 mb-4">• To achieve a successful nature design project, we have specialized teams for strong coordination between the various groups as needed. If, for instance, a home partner wants an oxygen generator or a Japanese atami mat flooring, sliding
                        doors, and wooden engawa verandas into a project, we do it. All our span specialists, from civil engineers and plumbers to landscape architects, are fully educated with the coordination process required to make this nature home

                    </p>
